## What happened ðŸ‘‹

I am not longer hosting any repositories on github.com. Instead all public repositories have been moved to my *self-hosted* git service at **[https://git.kudos.be](https://git.kudos.be)**. 

The move is the logical consequence of the ever further commercialization and exploitation of the Github platform by Microsoft.

I will keep my github account active for social interaction and sponsorships only.
