## What happened ðŸ‘‹

I am no longer hosting any repositories on github.com. Instead all public repositories have been moved to my *self-hosted* git service at **[https://git.kudos.be](https://git.kudos.be)**. 

The move is a logical response to the ever further commercialization and exploitation of the Github platform by Microsoft to which I very much disagree.

I will keep my github account active for social interaction and sponsorships only.
